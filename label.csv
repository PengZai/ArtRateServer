0,1,Bodynest交互式居家健身可穿戴设备,胡杰,产品装备,中国,"Under the influence of the epidemic, people spend less time outside, and they spend more time at home, which disrupts our original life. Less outdoor exercise results in less physical function. Many people are starting to exercise at home. At the same time, with the development of the Internet and the popularity of online live broadcasting, more and more people learn fitness through online learning and carry out fitness activities at home.
The rapid increase in the number of people working out has also naturally increased the chances of problems such as dizziness, arrhythmia and muscle damage due to lack of preparation, post-exercise stretching or the choice of an unsuitable intensity.
Through the combination of hardware and software, the program cleverly combines the process of fitness exercise with fitness protection, which ensures the safety of users during exercise to the greatest extent and avoids sports injury while users exercise scientifically. This scheme has designed three different protective tools, such as protective gloves, waist protection and knee protection, which cooperate with each other and are independent of each other.
Because kneepad, waist, and protective gloves are suitable for different sports. They can also detect the movement data of different parts. Therefore, while retaining the protective function of these protective devices, we can realize the correction of fitness knowledge through the analysis of a large amount of movement knowledge, which can avoid the possibility of injury to a large extent.
The shape and structure design of the scheme refer to the structure of castor cocoons. The semi-hollow structure solves the sweltering and binding feeling of traditional gloves and retains strong protective materials in areas with high probability of impact and injury. Through the collocation of a variety of materials, it makes the acquisition of a soft and comfortable feeling and a certain sense of science and technology. At the same time, the use of castor cocoon texture and protective combination, so that its texture has a certain characteristics and curve beauty.
Add the protective equipment we need to the connection with mobile devices by adding connected devices. When the user is doing various movements, the following alerts will be sent in front of the phone when the fitness protector detects excessive pressure and potential danger. The indicator light also turns red. The software also provides physical stress and injury analysis of recent sports. At the same time, the image of virtual human was introduced into the front design. Enhance the affinity of meeting, while allowing users to have a more intuitive experience.
The balance between ""fitness"" and ""safety"" and ""entertainment"" is highly bound. What this plan does is to lower the barrier of fitness and the possibility of injury, and make fitness really popular. In recent years, the caller platform gradually sinks, fitness can also.
Home fitness is just one entry point, and there may be many. In order to weaken the professionalism of fitness sports, reduce the possibility of injury, and enhance its fitness and entertainment functions, only the improvement of entertainment and safety can improve the acceptance of the public.

2,5,自闭症儿童体感游戏套件设计,徐雅娟,产品装备,中国,"Children with autism, known as ""children of the stars"", are typically characterized by social interaction difficulties, communication difficulties, narrow interests and stereotyped repetitive behaviors. In addition, most children with autism show hypersensitivity to touch. Or sluggishness and lack of fine hand movements. Somatosensory game is a game that relies on somatosensory technology and is operated through body movements. Somatosensory games have the following three advantages in the training of autistic children's hand movement ability: First, it can stimulate the interest of autistic children in training. The second is to train the coordination between the hand, eye and brain to improve the effect of intervention training. The third is that somatosensory games can create a relatively safe training environment.
This is a somatosensory game training kit designed for hand movement training for children with autism. It consists of gloves and bracelets. The screen of the bracelet shows the status of the device. When the somatosensory kit is enabled, there will be a gradient light effect. The bracelet records the child's heart rate, blood oxygen and other physical data in the game. Somatosensory gloves are a medium for somatosensory game interaction. Children with autism use somatosensory gloves to grasp and rotate in virtual scenes. When wearing them, they have a sense of actual hand load. The gloves have built-in multiple somatosensory feedback shock points to achieve a real virtual tactile experience. , especially in the tactile sensitive parts of the fingertips, there are fingertip tactile feedback components, which brings children a good immersive gaming experience. The gloves can accurately capture the child's hand movements during the game, and judge the training effect according to the stability and accuracy of the movements. In terms of appearance design, a bionic design is adopted to imitate the shape, color and image of rose buds, implying that children are flowers that need to be cared for and ready to bloom. The fingertip tactile feedback component adopts the shape of five cartoon characters with different expressions, which is interesting. In terms of color matching, blue, which is generally preferred by children with autism, is the main color, and bright pink and green are used to increase the layering of the product.
Autistic children interact with the game scene through hand movements and. Because autistic children have the problem of weak comprehension, the NPC character Little Prince in the game is designed. The little prince is based on the French children's literature ""The Little Prince"" The protagonist in the game is the prototype, and the little prince will guide the children to successfully complete the game tasks. Through the connection between the little prince and the rose, establish an emotional connection between the child and the game. In the dialogue and eye contact with the little prince, children's language communication and eye contact skills can be promoted.

（1）Product Design:
The survey found that with the increase of income level, more and more users are willing to be equipped with better listening equipment. How to meet the diverse listening needs of people in different scenarios? In the game, players often focus on the picture and ignore the sound prompts, resulting in a bad experience. Can there be a device that can enhance the sound prompts to bring a better experience to the user? Taking this as a starting point, this research uses the KANO model to investigate the needs of users for listening products, and prioritizes the needs. It is concluded that the needs of not disturbing others > the need for lightweight > the need to liberate both ears > The need for comfortable wearing > the need for long battery life > the need for other additional functions. Based on this conclusion, the product design is carried out.
Sound cannot be seen, but it can cause water ripples to be seen by the eyes. How to make more parts of the body feel the rhythm of the sound? Taking such modeling semantics, the appearance design of the product is carried out. In addition, partial hollowing out is carried out to achieve the lightweight design goal. The product is connected to the mobile terminal or PC terminal through Bluetooth, and the vibration module will simulate the vibration of different frequencies according to the music rhythm or game sound effect, thereby bringing a more realistic game experience or music experience, and users can adjust the vibration and sound volume by themselves. In addition, the design of the hang-neck stereo frees the user's ears without disturbing others.
The product use process is as follows: adjust the product to a suitable size and wear it on the neck; touch the power on and connect to the PC or mobile device through Bluetooth; the vibration module converts the sound signal into vibrations of different frequencies, which are transmitted to the body through the OSCI vibration actuator ; Achieve the design goal of enhancing the user's music/gaming experience.

6,12,交心流老人情感关怀智能穿戴产品,符敏婷,产品装备,中国,"1. Product name: Cross-flow Emotional Care Smart Wearable Product for the Elderly (Smart Wearable Product Design for the Elderly Based on Semiotic Perspective)
2. Personal Information: Fu Minting, Shenzhen University, Graduate Student of Product Design
3. Design Notes：
The digital divide among older people was magnified during the epidemic, with digital integration and the inability of older people to adapt to it leading to a greater sense of internal isolation than ever before. A review of data to understand the types of loneliness and the causes and effects of it revealed that there are few products designed to address this issue. An analysis of the silver-haired consumer sector reveals that the demand for products to alleviate loneliness among the elderly has led to a ""loneliness economy"". Secondly, the analysis of competing smart wearable products reveals that existing smart products lack emotional care and fail to meet the emotional needs of the elderly. Further, using the hierarchical analysis method, it was found that the key factor triggering loneliness among the elderly is family communication, and that family communication is the primary condition for meeting emotional needs. To sum up the above research, it was concluded that the core users of the design are young elderly people aged 60-65, to meet the needs of the elderly to get care from their children, socialise with friends, leisure and entertainment, as well as to meet the needs of children to care for their parents, and to refine the functions of the product.
This product is established in a system where smart wearable products are linked to a small program, through which children achieve the function of communicating care with the elderly who use the device. It explores how 3d printing can meet the individual needs of the hardware product, as well as the ergonomics of the product shape to meet the psychological needs of the elderly. In meeting the basic functions, combined with theories of semiotics and nostalgia therapy, we look for symbolic applications from the elderly's life experience in product modelling, interaction behaviour and style. The final leap between objective sketching of unconscious design, finding connections and product symbols is completed by the lens shape of the camera, the focusing action and the traditional patterns of the new Chinese style.
The details of the smart devices and interactive interfaces in the product system are described below. The first part is the details of the intelligent interactive devices. The product uses multi-sensory interaction such as light and sound to allow the elderly to obtain multiple feedback; the colour scheme of the product uses low brightness colours; the product material is made of skin-friendly materials such as liquid silicone lanyards to protect the skin of the elderly. Secondly, the product's metaphorical volume adjustment, the reasonable hand size and the consideration of the product's structure.The second part is the details of the interface design. Firstly, the product interaction interface is based on the user use process to develop the page design, with an overall gradient style and warm colours. Secondly, the functions of the children's side are composed of communication, sharing and my. The communication module allows for multi-mode communication, with brightly coloured icons to suggest guidance. The sharing module consists of community and family circle. It can be accessed by swiping up and down. The My module's auxiliary functions have an intimate care function. Finally, the seniors' interface highlights simplified content, enlarged text icons and strong colour contrast. In the communication section, voice communication and video are used to simplify communication and learning costs. A wealth of personal entertainment options and sharing alleviate the loneliness of children who are too busy to be with them, and information is accessed by swiping left and right.

The emergence of Guochao tuyere is not only the return of Chinese traditional culture, but also the embodiment of the enhancement of Chinese cultural self-confidence. This design scheme is based on the national fashion casual shoes with 3D printing, and takes comfort, youth and diversity as the design core, hoping to hit the hearts of more consumers.
1、 3D printed midsole for comfort
As most national fashion shoes on the market pay more attention to the design of appearance style, their comfort and durability are discounted to a certain extent. Aiming at this problem, landscape panda gives full play to the advantages of lean and personalized 3D printing support, and fills the lattice mesh surface and internal support of the midsole according to the stress analysis diagram of the sole, so as to improve the wearing comfort of the overall shoes.
2、 National style three-dimensional design gives full play to Chinese aesthetic style
Shoes tell stories, and what people wear on their feet can often reflect their environment and culture. National tide fever shows people's recognition of national culture and the improvement of cultural self-confidence. The so-called ""national tide"" and ""country"" refer to China, which is the expression of re examining China's local culture, products and brands from the perspective of globalization; ""Tide"" refers to the tide and trend, which should conform to the current design context and dynamics, and has the characteristics of the tide of the times and renewal and iteration. ""Landscape Panda"" integrates traditional pattern elements and current aesthetics, making it one of the carriers of Chinese traditional culture. It shows the ""national tide"" with new design forms, new design implications and new design styles. Select typical Chinese traditional elements with universal representation - ""Chinese landscape"", ""traditional calligraphy"" and ""national treasure panda"", together with the surface national tide small decoration, the combination of tradition and trend, and three-dimensional display of Chinese traditional culture and Chinese aesthetics.
3、 IP design helps to build the image of national fashion shoes
IP itself has natural cultural and emotional attributes, which can quickly, accurately and ruthlessly snipe users' pain points and attract attention to fans. As an indispensable part of the current mainstream culture, IP role can carry the function and significance of products. The combination of naive panda and trendy culture can collide with the image of overseas trendy panda IP, which will make users have a more sense of substitution and make the audience have emotional resonance.
4、 Summary
The application of 3D printing technology provides new ways and methods for footwear design, and expands the dimensions of lean, intelligent and personalized. In the design and production of footwear products, from materials and texture, to structure and function, and then to appearance and form, the introduction of 3D printing technology can bring new presentation methods and create more new possibilities. It is a slight pity that the high cost of 3D printing makes it difficult for shoes, a consumer product, to enter ordinary consumers. Perhaps there is a deviation in the track they choose, or their own attempts and efforts are not sufficient. However, it is hoped that 3D printing technology can give more play to its advantages in the field closer to consumers in the future.",75.5,69.1875,75.625,70.5625,73.8125,42.01533126831055,55.178123474121094,61.80167770385742,49.52817153930664,48.99833679199219,"[{'path': '14/hd/展板-山水熊猫-基于_3D_打印的国潮休闲鞋设计_王朝霞_2110506041-01.jpg'}, {'path': '14/hd/展板-山水熊猫-基于_3D_打印的国潮休闲鞋设计_王朝霞_2110506041-02.jpg'}, {'path': '14/hd/效果图1.jpg'}, {'path': '14/hd/效果图2.jpg'}, {'path': '14/hd/效果图3.jpg'}, {'path': '14/hd/效果图4.jpg'}, {'path': '14/hd/效果图5.jpg'}]"

The curriculum for the design exercise asks students to explore 3D technology that can be used for some sort of industrial or creative design. China is a huge trading nation for jade jewelry, which is often set in ancient costumes and hair ornaments throughout the 5,000 years of Chinese culture. Some jewelry also has the ability to ward off evil spirits and change luck, which stems from some Chinese feng shui fortune culture. Currently, jewelry companies in China are fully competitive due to a fragmented market and the presence of many small businesses. Therefore, emerging technologies could be very useful in this market.

This design aims to address three main issues. (1) The problem of reviving the ethnic style of jewelry: this segment of young women (under 35 years old) shows a great desire and spending power to buy jewelry accessories. The current jewelry designs in the market do not meet the aesthetics of young people, making the audience for such goods still too narrow. (2) Reduce the cost of ethnic style jewelry accessories: also produce jewelry with higher consumption levels, mainly using hand carving techniques, ethnic style jewelry. And generally have strict requirements for the material of the original stone, part of the corner but no one asked for. But generally young people do not have such a high level of consumption, so we need to reduce costs and improve the design content through 3D printing technology. (3) The problem of uniqueness: The industrial method of manufacturing accessories may make the accessories lack of personalization, so we need to use different materials. At the same time, we need to personalize our services by matching the different needs of users.

We design and create accessory brands using different high-tech materials and combining them with emerging scientific technologies, aiming to create new Chinese ethnic trendy accessories together with original stone materials.

14,20,A· F Wrist protector,Liu Lan,产品装备,,"First of all, my initial design inspiration is: in daily life, there are often unconsciously shaking legs, on the one hand, shaking legs will cause tables and chairs to vibrate and affect others; on the other hand, shaking legs will distract attention, affect work and study. So I wanted to use 3D printing technology to help design a leg protector that could stabilize the legs. But I wasn't sure what the value and significance of doing this was great, so I did a questionnaire survey with a total of 60 people, of which 40% were males, 60% were females, and the vast majority of them were 20-25 years old. The conclusion through the questionnaire survey is that ordinary people shaking their legs will not affect their lives so that they do not need to use specific products to improve, so I thought about what kind of people shaking their legs will have an impact on life, and then thought that extreme osteoporosis patients shaking their legs will cause great harm to the body, such as fractures, so I turned the direction of my research to such special groups.
The survey found that with the increase of China's elderly population, the incidence of osteoporosis is on the rise, which is a health problem worthy of attention in China and even the world. At present, the World Health Organization has listed osteoporosis, diabetes and cardiovascular disease as the three major killers that endanger the health of middle-aged and elderly people. The most common sites of osteoporotic fractures are the spine, hip, and wrist. Wrist fractures are the most common type of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly. When a person is about to fall, he will reflexively extend his palm to touch the ground to support and protect the body. At this time, the gravity of the body will be concentrated on the radius at the distal end of the forearm and fracture will occur. At this time, because the wrist is mostly in the straight position of the force, the distal end of the fracture is displaced to the dorsal side of the hand, and the wrist is viewed from the side, which will show a special spatula-like ""deformity."" So I chose to start my design from the wrist: using 3D printing technology to help customize a wrist brace to prevent wrist fractures in osteoporosis patients. After that, I went to collect various 3D printing and wrist protector information and pictures to lay the groundwork for the later design, and then interviewed osteoporosis patients and recorded the conversation content, followed by some of the steps to be carried out in the conventional design, user portraits, inspiration plates, sketches, sketches, and so on. Next up are my product design instructions. 
Printing the whole is composed of four parts, three gray-black parts are a palm part and two wrist parts plus a hand of the main part, the use of nylon material in hardness and toughness is strong, used to prevent the elderly daily life of the fall caused by fractures, the main part of the middle of the hollow shape can increase the wrist part of the activity area, with ropes to connect the three parts to achieve the effect of prevention.

17,23,3D打印穿戴式设备设计 多用便携旅行枕,吴旻祈,家居生活,中国,"This travel pillow is designed for patients with cervical spondylosis and people with long-distance travel needs. It combines both headphones and travel pillow‘s function to provide stronger support for the neck and maximize noise reduction while providing better sleep assistance. At the same time, the flexible adjustability makes the products meet different human needs. 3D printing technology is conducive not only to personalized customization and adjust the relationship between body and cushion, but also improved the quality of sleeping during travel. It also reduce daily neck fatigue, and contribute to spinal correction.
According to research, I found that whether there is a good travel pillow for us to have a long enough rest when we travel by car or flying for a long time is something we have to consider in the process of travel
Through my experience, most popular travel pillows in the market do not have much support or fitnesses, they can’t bring a good sense of experience else. Even worse, they may bring the chance of neck stiffness and shoulder pain.
Pillow needs to support the neck without feeling suspended. The most common U-shaped travel pillow generally believes that the most balanced posture of the spine is neutral posture, it can minimize the pressure on the body. But most people don't keep a neutral position when they sleep. This haven’t take care of different sleeping positions, and easy to increase the burden on the neck and lower back, resulting in neck stiffness or back pain when waking up. Some people with cervical discomfort not only need functional pillows on the road but also when going out for the night, but ordinary lying down pillows and travel pillows can’t combine at the same time, and it is not practical to carry them both.
It is estimated that nearly a quarter of the population will have neck pain, and bad pillow design is an important factor leading to this extremely high incidence rate. Improper pillow support has adverse effects on the cervical spine, resulting in not only neck pain and cervical headache, but also ultimately poor sleep quality.
In particular, patients with cervical spondylosis need to choose a pillow suitable for cervical physiological curvature according to the degree of cervical spondylosis and the principle of restoring cervical physiological curvature. This physiological curve not only ensures the external muscle balance of the cervical spine, but also maintains the physiological and anatomical state in the spinal canal. At the same time, the shape of Chinese YUANBAO with soft texture and good air permeability can also play a relative braking and fixation role on the head and neck, and reduce the abnormal activity of the head and neck during sleep.
The depth of cervical physiological curve is measured by Borden's measurement method. This personalized cervical pillow can also be customized. TPU powder material is selected to avoid the problems like texture is too soft and poor correction effect. There is no personalized orthopedic planning, and soft materials will also cause the correction strength and correction results to follow suit. Choosing an inappropriate pillow size may cause neck pain or aggravation. Everyone has different cervical curvature and different cervical soft tissue conditions. Some patients are in different stages of cervical spondylosis. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out personalized 3D printing cervical pillow design and personalized correction of cervical curvature. And the elasticity of soft tissues such as tendons and ligaments around the cervical spine.
During sleeping, noise penetrates the brain and activates two important areas of the brain, the auditory cortex and the amygdala, which stimulates a person's combat response. Especially in public transport, noise reduction can ensure better quality sleeping. In order to further improve the sleep quality, I use BBT technology to induce users to relieve psychological pressure and promote physical relaxation, so as to quickly enter the deep sleep state. In addition to the recommended mixing provided by the supporting app, users can also combine their preferences to find their own hypnotic music. Users can find their own deep and shallow sleep time zone through the sleep monitoring function. The intimate timing function solves the embarrassment that the alarm clock affects others, in public places.

With the acceleration of social rhythm and the continuous entry of new materials and new ideas, the boundary of jewelry becomes more and more blurred. In addition to traditional precious metals, jewelry materials, silica gel, plastic and so on. In order to meet the increasingly rich personalized needs of consumers, various jewelry accessories came into being, and 3D printing technology can not only provide greater design freedom, but also fully customize the design, meet the customization, and carry out one-time production economically and efficiently. 48 questionnaires were collected in the early stage of design. The results show that the wearing rate of necklaces and earrings is the highest, and I hope the jewelry is special and relatively low-key.
In the design direction, it should be personalized and customized with 3D printing technology. It mainly focuses on the design and research of structure, adopts the structural modularization mode and element sharing, creates different uses and different connection modes with similar and the same structural modeling, tries a variety of combination modes: track, intersperse, stretch, overlap, hollowing out, texture, etc., and designs a modular, multi combination jewelry that is different from traditional jewelry. It is hoped that users can create a semi DIY way of interaction and thinking by themselves, which can inspire users to discover themselves, explore their true self, and start a dialogue with themselves and an interaction with nature.

This work is made with 3D printing technology and takes the maple leaf in nature as the design prototype. It is the most natural and original image. It is intended to explore women's definition of self, face self, know self, discover self, accept self, inspire users to think about self, talk with themselves and whisper to nature. Named ""the whisper of Maple"", we also hope that users can face life with a natural and free mind, just like walking in the shade of autumn, with the wind blowing the trees, the fallen leaves in the body, talking to the wind and whispering with the leaves, which can be cured by nature and the fallen leaves in the heart.
Continuous improvement in modeling, from plane to three-dimensional, from floating to rigid, from sharp to round, to create a light and beautiful, but also tenacious and powerful female image. Finally, a modular jewelry with a certain sense of elasticity and weight can be formed.

Therefore, using the technology of 3D printing and the structural characteristics of 3D printing, we explore a sports arm bag with different modeling structure and increased aesthetics.

The characteristics of high temperature resistance and shock absorption can protect the athlete. The soft and non deformable characteristics can make the arm bag fit the arm better, and the surface is made of frosted material, which can make the mobile phone easier to put and take. The back strap uses Velcro, which allows users to freely adjust the tightness and allow more different people to use it. Finally, in terms of color selection, it provides users with three series of color matching to meet the needs of different styles of the public, including gradient color system, dark color system and fan color system.

Because they know each other, they find the inner essence of each other after going through a lot of things, and then attract each other and fall in love.In the design of earrings, I adopted the concept of upside down. In terms of color, red and white are combined. I exaggerated the design of the shape of the eyes, and used red transparent materials as eyes for embellishment. The right ear is on the eye. It means that in the play, the role is on the side of the leader at first, and this role is high above all; The left ear is with the eyes down, which indicates that the role is initially on the side of the guided person. This role is not firm. The two have been testing each other and examining each other, and their fate is intertwined. In this process, the relationship is sometimes close and sometimes alienated. Therefore, in addition to the eye decoration, I also use regular but inconsistent sheet decoration for arrangement, in order to express the stability and instability of the relationship between the two through subtle details.In the design of the ring, I adopted the design method of imitating the growth of the bone cone, in which the left ring grows positively and the right ring grows inversely, implying that the two are in a black and white relationship. Nevertheless, they are deeply attracted by each other and come together in a bloody, strange, but affectionate way to produce love, just like in my design., The direction of the two rings is almost to touch each other. The growth and touch of the two bone cones are like walking into each other's deepest heart.I think the story between the two characters is the most dangerous and charming love story.
