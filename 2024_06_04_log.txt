During this era, an evil dragon resided in the sea, causing widespread chaos. Despite this, no officials or nobles were willing to intervene; they remained lost in their revelries. A man from the north, with the help of a celestial being, rose to the occasion, gathering popular support to seal the evil dragon within an artifact. Using the dragon’s power, he punished evil, promoted good, pacified the land, and established peace, thus forming a prosperous nation. It was said that whoever possessed the bracelet would rule the world. However, this did not bring tranquility; instead, countless conflicts arose in pursuit of this artifact. Eventually, the seal on the bracelet weakened, and the dragon was released, returning directly to the celestial realm without wreaking further havoc on the world. Thus, the struggle for power continued; gaining the dragon’s essence was merely a pretext for justifying the claim to the throne. In the end, whether the dragon was the true evil or whether the calamities were man-made remains unknown. The tribulations endured by the world, whether caused by provoking the dragon clan or human ambition, are left to history. This bracelet, known by later generations as “The Gale Calamity,” carries the name of this tumultuous legacy.","author":"Xia Qian","email":"luojing@szu.edu.cn"}'}
