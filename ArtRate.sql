Therefore, the design of Mengzuo portable moxibustion instrument adheres to open fire moxibustion, and integrates modern technology to create a portable, easy-to-use, professionally visualized moxibustion system.\nMengzuo APP can accurately reach the lesion, specify detailed physiotherapy plans for users, provide professional private Chinese medicine-style experience, and visualize the treatment course to help users use the product better.','1249771684@qq.com','2022-06-09 14:23:54.910379',3),(3,'Somatosensory Game Kit','Yajuan Xu','产品装备','中国','Children with autism, known as \"children of the stars\", are typically characterized by social interaction difficulties, communication difficulties, narrow interests and stereotyped repetitive behaviors. In addition, most children with autism show hypersensitivity to touch. Or sluggishness and lack of fine hand movements. Somatosensory game is a game that relies on somatosensory technology and is operated through body movements. Somatosensory games have the following three advantages in the training of autistic children\'s hand movement ability: First, it can stimulate the interest of autistic children in training. The second is to train the coordination between the hand, eye and brain to improve the effect of intervention training. The third is that somatosensory games can create a relatively safe training environment.\nThis is a somatosensory game training kit designed for hand movement training for children with autism. It consists of gloves and bracelets. The screen of the bracelet shows the status of the device. When the somatosensory kit is enabled, there will be a gradient light effect. The bracelet records the child\'s heart rate, blood oxygen and other physical data in the game. Somatosensory gloves are a medium for somatosensory game interaction. Children with autism use somatosensory gloves to grasp and rotate in virtual scenes. When wearing them, they have a sense of actual hand load. The gloves have built-in multiple somatosensory feedback shock points to achieve a real virtual tactile experience. , especially in the tactile sensitive parts of the fingertips, there are fingertip tactile feedback components, which brings children a good immersive gaming experience. The gloves can accurately capture the child\'s hand movements during the game, and judge the training effect according to the stability and accuracy of the movements. In terms of appearance design, a bionic design is adopted to imitate the shape, color and image of rose buds, implying that children are flowers that need to be cared for and ready to bloom. The fingertip tactile feedback component adopts the shape of five cartoon characters with different expressions, which is interesting. In terms of color matching, blue, which is generally preferred by children with autism, is the main color, and bright pink and green are used to increase the layering of the product.\nAutistic children interact with the game scene through hand movements and. Because autistic children have the problem of weak comprehension, the NPC character Little Prince in the game is designed. The little prince is based on the French children\'s literature \"The Little Prince\" The protagonist in the game is the prototype, and the little prince will guide the children to successfully complete the game tasks. Through the connection between the little prince and the rose, establish an emotional connection between the child and the game. In the dialogue and eye contact with the little prince, children\'s language communication and eye contact skills can be promoted.\nParents can turn on and off the device on the APP, adjust the strength of glove tactile feedback, formulate training plans, and view game records, evaluation reports, physical data and other data.','842585738@qq.com','2022-06-09 20:31:58.215951',5),(4,'Bonest交互式居家健身可穿戴设备','Hujie','运动健康','中国','Under the influence of the epidemic, people spend less time outside, and they spend more time at home, which disrupts our original life. Less outdoor exercise results in less physical function. Many people are starting to exercise at home. At the same time, with the development of the Internet and the popularity of online live broadcasting, more and more people learn fitness through online learning and carry out fitness activities at home.\nThe rapid increase in the number of people working out has also naturally increased the chances of problems such as dizziness, arrhythmia, and muscle damage due to lack of preparation, post-exercise stretching, or the choice of an unsuitable intensity.\nThrough the combination of hardware and software, the program cleverly combines the process of fitness exercise with fitness protection, which ensures the safety of users during exercise to the greatest extent and avoids sports injury while users exercise scientifically. This scheme has designed three different protective tools, such as protective gloves, waist protection, and knee protection, which cooperate and are independent of each other.\nBecause kneepad, waist, and protective gloves are suitable for different sports. They can also detect the movement data of different parts. Therefore, while retaining the protective function of these protective devices, we can realize the correction of fitness knowledge through the analysis of a large amount of movement knowledge, which can avoid the possibility of injury to a large extent.\nThe shape and structure design of the scheme refers to the structure of castor cocoons. The semi-hollow structure solves the sweltering and binding feeling of traditional gloves and retains strong protective materials in areas with a high probability of impact and injury. The collocation of a variety of materials acquires a soft and comfortable feeling and a certain sense of science and technology. At the same time, the use of castor cocoon texture and protective combination, so that its texture has certain characteristics and curve beauty.\nThe APP adopts a dark style as a whole, and at the same time pays attention to the cooperation of software and hardware, and introduces the virtual human image into the interface design. \n1.

Safety design When the user is performing various actions, the following reminders will be issued in front of the mobile phone when the fitness protective gear detects that the pressure is too high and potential dangers are found. At the same time, the indicator light will also turn red. The software also provides physical stress and injury analysis of recent sports.\nAdd the protective equipment we need to the connection with mobile devices by adding connected devices.

What this plan does is lower the barrier to fitness and the possibility of injury, and make fitness popular. In recent years, the caller platform gradually sunk, and fitness can also.\nHome fitness is just one entry point, and there may be many.

In addition, the design of the hang-neck stereo frees the user\'s ears without disturbing others.\n（1）Product Design:\nThe survey found that with the increase of income level, more and more users are willing to be equipped with better listening equipment. How to meet the diverse listening needs of people in different scenarios? In the game, players often focus on the picture and ignore the sound prompts, resulting in a bad experience. Can there be a device that can enhance the sound prompts to bring a better experience to the user? Taking this as a starting point, this research uses the KANO model to investigate the needs of users for listening products, and prioritizes the needs. It is concluded that the needs of not disturbing others > the need for lightweight > the need to liberate both ears > The need for comfortable wearing > the need for long battery life > the need for other additional functions. Based on this conclusion, the product design is carried out.\nSound cannot be seen, but it can cause water ripples to be seen by the eyes. How to make more parts of the body feel the rhythm of the sound? Taking such modeling semantics, the appearance design of the product is carried out. In addition, partial hollowing out is carried out to achieve the lightweight design goal. The product is connected to the mobile terminal or PC terminal through Bluetooth, and the vibration module will simulate the vibration of different frequencies according to the music rhythm or game sound effect, thereby bringing a more realistic game experience or music experience, and users can adjust the vibration and sound volume by themselves. In addition, the design of the hang-neck stereo frees the user\'s ears without disturbing others.\nThe product use process is as follows: adjust the product to a suitable size and wear it on the neck; touch the power on and connect to the PC or mobile device through Bluetooth; the vibration module converts the sound signal into vibrations of different frequencies, which are transmitted to the body through the OSCI vibration actuator ; Achieve the design goal of enhancing the user\'s music/gaming experience.\n（2）APP design:\nAPP positioning is a sharing and dating platform for music enthusiasts, Viber users and potential users. The design goal is to help users find friends nearby, expand the circle of friends, and help the Viber users to discover more potential of the product.

So I wanted to use 3D printing technology to help design a leg protector that could stabilize the legs. But I wasn\'t sure what the value and significance of doing this was great, so I did a questionnaire survey with a total of 60 people, of which 40% were males, 60% were females, and the vast majority of them were 20-25 years old. The conclusion through the questionnaire survey is that ordinary people shaking their legs will not affect their lives so that they do not need to use specific products to improve, so I thought about what kind of people shaking their legs will have an impact on life, and then thought that extreme osteoporosis patients shaking their legs will cause great harm to the body, such as fractures, so I turned the direction of my research to such special groups.\nThe survey found that with the increase of China\'s elderly population, the incidence of osteoporosis is on the rise, which is a health problem worthy of attention in China and even the world. At present, the World Health Organization has listed osteoporosis, diabetes and cardiovascular disease as the three major killers that endanger the health of middle-aged and elderly people. The most common sites of osteoporotic fractures are the spine, hip, and wrist. Wrist fractures are the most common type of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly. When a person is about to fall, he will reflexively extend his palm to touch the ground to support and protect the body. At this time, the gravity of the body will be concentrated on the radius at the distal end of the forearm and fracture will occur. At this time, because the wrist is mostly in the straight position of the force, the distal end of the fracture is displaced to the dorsal side of the hand, and the wrist is viewed from the side, which will show a special spatula-like \"deformity.\" So I chose to start my design from the wrist: using 3D printing technology to help customize a wrist brace to prevent wrist fractures in osteoporosis patients. After that, I went to collect various 3D printing and wrist protector information and pictures to lay the groundwork for the later design, and then interviewed osteoporosis patients and recorded the conversation content, followed by some of the steps to be carried out in the conventional design, user portraits, inspiration plates, sketches, sketches, and so on. Next up are my product design instructions. \nPrinting the whole is composed of four parts, three gray-black parts are a palm part and two wrist parts plus a hand of the main part, the use of nylon material in hardness and toughness is strong, used to prevent the elderly daily life of the fall caused by fractures, the main part of the middle of the hollow shape can increase the wrist part of the activity area, with ropes to connect the three parts to achieve the effect of prevention. The overall size is about 88mm long, 86mm wide and 186mm high.

So I wanted to use 3D printing technology to help design a leg protector that could stabilize the legs. But I wasn\'t sure what the value and significance of doing this was great, so I did a questionnaire survey with a total of 60 people, of which 40% were males, 60% were females, and the vast majority of them were 20-25 years old. The conclusion through the questionnaire survey is that ordinary people shaking their legs will not affect their lives so that they do not need to use specific products to improve, so I thought about what kind of people shaking their legs will have an impact on life, and then thought that extreme osteoporosis patients shaking their legs will cause great harm to the body, such as fractures, so I turned the direction of my research to such special groups.\nThe survey found that with the increase of China\'s elderly population, the incidence of osteoporosis is on the rise, which is a health problem worthy of attention in China and even the world. At present, the World Health Organization has listed osteoporosis, diabetes and cardiovascular disease as the three major killers that endanger the health of middle-aged and elderly people. The most common sites of osteoporotic fractures are the spine, hip, and wrist. Wrist fractures are the most common type of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly. When a person is about to fall, he will reflexively extend his palm to touch the ground to support and protect the body. At this time, the gravity of the body will be concentrated on the radius at the distal end of the forearm and fracture will occur. At this time, because the wrist is mostly in the straight position of the force, the distal end of the fracture is displaced to the dorsal side of the hand, and the wrist is viewed from the side, which will show a special spatula-like \"deformity.\" So I chose to start my design from the wrist: using 3D printing technology to help customize a wrist brace to prevent wrist fractures in osteoporosis patients. After that, I went to collect various 3D printing and wrist protector information and pictures to lay the groundwork for the later design, and then interviewed osteoporosis patients and recorded the conversation content, followed by some of the steps to be carried out in the conventional design, user portraits, inspiration plates, sketches, sketches, and so on.

Such a large population base will bring many derivative problems. Cigarettes will not only harm your smokers and the people around you, but also cause serious pollution to the environment.

It also reduce daily neck fatigue, and contribute to spinal correction.\nAccording to research, I found that whether there is a good travel pillow for us to have a long enough rest when we travel by car or flying for a long time is something we have to consider in the process of travel\nThrough my experience, most popular travel pillows in the market do not have much support or fitnesses, they can’t bring a good sense of experience else. Even worse, they may bring the chance of neck stiffness and shoulder pain.\nPillow needs to support the neck without feeling suspended. The most common U-shaped travel pillow generally believes that the most balanced posture of the spine is neutral posture, it can minimize the pressure on the body. But most people don\'t keep a neutral position when they sleep. This haven’t take care of different sleeping positions, and easy to increase the burden on the neck and lower back, resulting in neck stiffness or back pain when waking up. Some people with cervical discomfort not only need functional pillows on the road but also when going out for the night, but ordinary lying down pillows and travel pillows can’t combine at the same time, and it is not practical to carry them both.\nIt is estimated that nearly a quarter of the population will have neck pain, and bad pillow design is an important factor leading to this extremely high incidence rate. Improper pillow support has adverse effects on the cervical spine, resulting in not only neck pain and cervical headache, but also ultimately poor sleep quality.\nIn particular, patients with cervical spondylosis need to choose a pillow suitable for cervical physiological curvature according to the degree of cervical spondylosis and the principle of restoring cervical physiological curvature. This physiological curve not only ensures the external muscle balance of the cervical spine, but also maintains the physiological and anatomical state in the spinal canal. At the same time, the shape of Chinese YUANBAO with soft texture and good air permeability can also play a relative braking and fixation role on the head and neck, and reduce the abnormal activity of the head and neck during sleep.\nThe depth of cervical physiological curve is measured by Borden\'s measurement method. This personalized cervical pillow can also be customized. TPU powder material is selected to avoid the problems like texture is too soft and poor correction effect. There is no personalized orthopedic planning, and soft materials will also cause the correction strength and correction results to follow suit. Choosing an inappropriate pillow size may cause neck pain or aggravation. Everyone has different cervical curvature and different cervical soft tissue conditions.
